# Install Bash Shell on your Local Computer

### Bash
In Week 5 of the Data Workshop, we will be working with a command line interface available. That means, we'll be issuing commands to the computer by typing 
them, not by clicking things in the Graphical User Interface (GIU). This is a helpful skill if you:
* log into a remote computer like a supercomputer, or
* need to perform a set of repetitive tasks.

The interface we will be using is called the "bash shell". To use it, you might need to install  
software on your computer.  The instructions for this are different depending on whether you are using a Windows, Mac, or Linux PC.

Instructions for accessing the shell can be found at [The Unix Shell: Setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html), which is part of the 
Carpentries lesson we will be doing.

### A Second Screen?

The lesson in Week 5 will be interactive; I will type commands on my computer, and you will repeat what I do on your own computer. The lesson was designed to 
be done in a room altogether with a big screen in the front. When you are working on a laptop, it might be difficult to both see what I am doing _and_ do it
yourself because of the small screen.

It may be helpful to have 2 screens. For instance, you could log into the meeting on your phone, and type the commands on your computer. It won't be impossible 
if you don't have access to 2 screens. Please take a minute to develop a system to see 2 windows at once.

### Ask for Help
If you cannot get this software installed, be sure and ask for help!  You will not be able to participate if you can't get the shell working.
