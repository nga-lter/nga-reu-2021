# Install Git on your Local Computer

### Version Control with Git

Version control systems like git are often associated with programming projects. However, version control tracks changes in any 
type of file. Being able to track changes is essential in reproducible research. 

During the bash shell lesson, we started working with some files I named draft_v1.txt and draft_v2.txt. Rather than using the file
names to track the versions, we will use git in an interactive lesson on our computer to track the changes in that text file.

To do this, we will need to have the bash shell and git running on all our computers.  Instructions for doing that can be found at 
the [Carpentries Workshop Template](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git)

### Notes

If you have a Windows PC and used Git For Windows to install the bash shell, you already have git.

If you have a Mac, there is a video on that page. You might need administrator privileges to install it since it is not software
distributed by Apple.  Also, you'll probably also need to install a program called XCode.  This all takes awhile, so don't wait
until the last minute.

We won't need a GitHub account quite yet.  We'll do that next week.

To test your installation is complete, at your terminal bash prompt, type:
```
$ git --version
```
You should get a sensible reply.  If not, ask Liz for help.
