# Get a GitHub Account

## Assigned 7/26/2021

## Due 8/2/2021

### Version Control with Git

You will need an account at [github.com](https://github.com/) for the next parts of the Git lesson. 
Basic GitHub accounts are free. You are encouraged to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. 
You can do it by following the instructions at [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)

Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. 
For example, you may want to review 
[these instructions provided by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
for keeping your email address private.

### Note
Note: through your University, you might have an account on a GitHub enterprise server. For instance, UAF has one of those. 
Repositories on the UAF server are not publically accessible and won't work for the lesson we are doing on collaboration. 
You need to have (another?) account on GitHub.com. Talk to Liz if you think you might be in this situation.
