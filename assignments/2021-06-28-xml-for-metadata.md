# Preparation for Metadata Lesson

## Assigned 6/28/2021

## Due 7/7/2021

On 7/7/2021, we will be looking metadata contents and formats. Sometimes, when you look at examples of metadata, you will see extra notations interspersed amidst the
actual metadata. The notations are strings that begin with the character "<" and end with a ">". In those cases, the metadata has been written in a format called XML -
eXtensible Markup Language.

XML is a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. You don't need to know everything about XML to write metadata. However, recognizing the elements of 
the markup language will help you focus on the metadata itself without getting too distracted or overwhelmed.

Before our next meeting, please read [W3 School's Introduction to XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp). 

Most of the information about XML is written for computer programmers so is much more complex than we need.  However, if you are interested in learning how to read
and write XML files, you could also read [What is an XML File (And How Do I Open One)](https://www.howtogeek.com/357092/what-is-an-xml-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/), 
but you don't have to.
