On 6/28/2021, we will be looking at a spreadsheet through the lens of the Tidy Data philosophy.
To save time during the meeeting, please download and look at this spreadsheet ahead of time.

1. Create a folder or directory on your local computer or Google Drive and give it a good, descriptive name.
2. Follow the instructions at [Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists: Setup](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/setup.html) and download the file survey_data_spreadsheet_messy.xls.  Put it in your new folder.
3. Prepare to look at the data by ensuring your computer has one of the following programs available:
  * Microsoft Excel
  * Mac Numbers
  * LibreOffice (instructions on the webpage above)
  * Google Sheets
4. Open the file in your chosen spreadsheet program. Make sure you can see three tabs, and scroll around to become familiar with how the spreadsheet is organized.
5. You will also need a way to edit a text file, so make sure you have a word processor or text editor or something.
