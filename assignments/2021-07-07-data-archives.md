# Presentations on Data Archives

## Assigned 7/7/2021

## Due 7/12/2021

There are many national (or international) archives where you can find data that might apply to your summer research project. Because you
are all studying different fields, we don't have time to discuss all the possibilites. Instead, I'd like you to find one applicable
dataset on your own, and present your findings to the group.

### Instructions

1. Go to one of the archives listed below, or ask your advisor for the web address of an archive related to your field.
2. Try a search for data that is related to what you are studying this summer.
3. Identify one related dataset.
4. Prepare slides to show to the group with the following information:
  * Information on the archive: Who runs the archive? What type of data can be found there?
  * Information on the dataset: What is it? Where was data collected? Who collected it? Can you use the file formats?
  * Information on the metdata: Can you download metadata? What format is it? Can you read it?
  * Is there a way to download a citation?
5. Be prepared to show your slide during our next session.
